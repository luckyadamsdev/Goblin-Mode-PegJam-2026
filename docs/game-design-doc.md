| goblins are mischievous.  We want to create a chaotic feeling. Fast paced and clumsy. | We want the game to "feel good" on first contact. Easy to understand and fun to play with without rules or scores being added | We want people to laugh. Situations that create tension and relief are what we are looking for. If people are laughing we are suceeding |
## Elevator pitch
Goblins are escaping down hill! They've stolen a valuable staff from a wizard, there is only one staff and they don't want to share. Whoever reaches the bottom of the hill with the staff gets too keep it! But watch out, the mountain is full of hazards, and the wizard is not pleased!

## Art Direction
